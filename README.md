# Weather Dashboard by Captain Flint

## Description

The goal of this project was to generate weather data for cities searched by the user, including a five-day-forecast and a pinned list of past cities to be revisited. This was achieved by making calls to the OpenWeather API, as well as the saving of cities to local storage. In working on this I greatly improved my familiarity with server-side API's in particular, as well as with various javascript methods and bootstrap methods in html.

## Installation

NA

## Usage

Enter city name into text box and click search. If you wish to revisit a past search, click on button for given city under the search container. The clear button will wipe your history for the current session. Reloading the page will also clear history.
